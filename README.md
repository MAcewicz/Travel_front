# Welcome
This is a front-end for my porfolio app. I do NOT plan to become a front-end or full-stack developer at the moment, therefore please
do not judge me by this code as it is total mess. I just wanted to make it work as fast as possible and focus on back-end.
Link to Heroku soon.

Link to back-end repository:

Thanks you.
